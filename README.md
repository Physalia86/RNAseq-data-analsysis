Course: ANALYSIS OF RNA SEQUENCING DATA WITH R/BIOCONDUCTOR



Dates
November 7-18, 2022
Due to the COVID-19 outbreak, this course will be held online
 
OVERVIEW
This course will provide biologists and bioinformaticians with practical  statistical analysis skills to perform rigorous analysis of high-throughput  genomic data. The course assumes basic familiarity with genomics and with R  programming, but does not assume prior statistical training.  It covers the statistical concepts necessary to analyze genomic and transcriptomic  high-throughput data generated by next-generation sequencing, including:  hypothesis testing, data visualization, genomic region analysis, differential  expression analysis, and gene set analysis.
